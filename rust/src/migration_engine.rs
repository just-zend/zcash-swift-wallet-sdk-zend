//! What remains SDK-side of wiring this wallet database into the pool-migration engine.
//!
//! [`zcash_pool_migration`]'s engine works over four traits — `MigrationBackend` (notes and chain
//! tip), `MigrationCrypto` (viewing key, note plaintexts), and `PoolMigrationRead` /
//! `PoolMigrationWrite` (the store). Both halves are upstream's: the crate's own
//! [`WalletMigration`] adapter serves the first two over any `zcash_client_backend` wallet, and
//! `zcash_client_sqlite`'s account-scoped `PoolMigrations` is the store it wraps. This SDK no
//! longer forks either. What is left here is the three joints that are genuinely this wallet's:
//!
//! - [`account_store`] opens the account-scoped store. `PoolMigrations::for_account` needs the
//!   network parameters and clock the wallet handle itself was built with (its
//!   `store_proved_transaction` finalizes into the wallet's own tables, which needs branch ids and
//!   a creation timestamp), and it scopes the migration to ONE account — so a wallet database
//!   hosting a seed-derived account next to a UFVK-imported Keystone account migrates them
//!   independently. Every operation that is purely a store operation takes this directly.
//! - [`stored_ufvk`] is the one thing upstream deliberately leaves to the caller: [`WalletMigration`]
//!   takes the account's unified full viewing key as a CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETER rather than reading
//!   the account record, because a wallet may hold several keys that view one account and only the
//!   caller knows which the migration's notes belong to. This SDK's answer is always the key the
//!   account record stores, which is also what lets an imported hardware-wallet account — whose
//!   spending key never exists on this device — plan, build and prove here.
//! - [`account_migration`] is the two together: the adapter every engine call that needs
//!   `MigrationBackend` / `MigrationCrypto` (planning, estimating, committing, rebuilding) is
//!   handed.
//!
//! There is no spending key in this module, and no way to give the adapter one — [`WalletMigration`]
//! holds viewing authority and offers no constructor that takes more. The engine's two signing
//! entry points take an `orchard::keys::SpendingKey` per call — deriving its full viewing key and
//! refusing eagerly if it does not match the account's, before building anything — so the FFI
//! functions that sign pass the spending key they just decoded straight through and drop it with
//! the call.
//!
//! Proving (`engine::MigrationProver`) is upstream's `wallet::WalletMigrationProver` over a
//! separate MUTABLE wallet borrow: resolving witnesses needs the note commitment tree, which the
//! shared borrow the adapter holds cannot provide. It is dispatched per transaction kind (boundary
//! anchor for transfers, preparation anchor for preparations) in [`crate::migration_finalize`],
//! and takes the account's Orchard viewing key from [`stored_orchard_fvk`].
