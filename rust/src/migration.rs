//! Orchard to Ironwood pool migration.
//!
//! Builds on the upstream `propose_send_max_transfer`, which spends the entire
//! spendable balance of a chosen set of shielded pools to one recipient with
//! the fee computed so nothing is left over. This module only pins the
//! parameters that make that call the pool migration; it is not a general
//! send-max and none is exposed.
